Now I have added ASSERT(), and ASSERTF(): use them - scan all the functions. == IMPORTANT!!

Resource:
    - Check -> PROBABLY

Texture:
    - Parse texture atlas -

Renderer:
    - Implement batch rendering
    - Use global vao
    - struct EZBatchRenderer;
    -  FOR NOW, (until a struct EZRenderer struct is implemented and contains w and h) pass w and h as params. (BAD)
    - also change the orth matrix based on w and h (callback funcs)

Sprite:
    - ASSERTION!

Log:
    - DEBUG_ENABLED doesn't work

Camera:
    - Matrices: sir yes sir
    - Position
    - Move camera by keyboard input

Input:
    - implement

Scene:
    - have camera
    - bind the renderer
    - gameobjs

Renderer:
    - idk

Also:
    - Move sprite by keyboard input, not the CAMERA!!

CMAKE:
    - GLFW loc, CGLM loc

FIXME:
    - None (thankfully)
