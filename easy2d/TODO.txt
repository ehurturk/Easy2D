Now I have added ASSERT(), and ASSERTF(): use them - scan all the functions. == IMPORTANT!!

Shader:
    - Load & parse shaders. -> OK
    - Free() -> OK

Resource:
    - Check -> PROBABLY

Texture:
    - Load Textures - OK (not tested yet)
    - Initial texture is default white => could be achieved?
    - Parse texture atlas -
    - multiple active texture slots. => OK
    - ERROR WHEN DISPLAY !! Find it.
        - CAUSE: Width and height of resource loading. Find a solution.Width becomes 50325 (w * h), h is OK btw. Must be 305 165
        SO, TODO is to be able to extracr both w and h from an image while keeping the file format too. (maybe hints as params? e.g. ezLoadResource(EZ_TEX, ...) or ezLoadResource(EZ_FILE, ...))

Renderer:
    - Implement batch rendering
    - Use global vao
    - struct EZBatchRenderer;

Sprite:
    - Release Sprite - OK
    - ASSERTION!

Log:
    - DEBUG_ENABLED doesn't work

FIXME:
    - None (thankfully)
