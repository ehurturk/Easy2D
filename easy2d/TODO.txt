Now I have added ASSERT(), and ASSERTF(): use them - scan all the functions. == IMPORTANT!!

Resource:
    - Check -> PROBABLY

Texture:
    - Parse texture atlas -

Renderer:
    - Implement batch rendering
    - Use global vao
    - struct EZBatchRenderer;
    - Implement ortho projection.
    -  FOR NOW, (until a struct EZRenderer struct is implemented and contains w and h) pass w and h as params. (BAD)

Sprite:
    - ASSERTION!

Math:
    - Orthographic projection!!
    - Compatible with GL?

Log:
    - DEBUG_ENABLED doesn't work

CMAKE:
    - GLFW loc, CGLM loc

FIXME:
    - None (thankfully)
