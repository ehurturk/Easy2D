Now I have added ASSERT(), and ASSERTF(): use them - scan all the functions. == IMPORTANT!!

Shader:
    - Load & parse shaders. -> OK
    - Free() -> OK

Resource:
    - Check -> PROBABLY

Texture:
    - Load Textures - OK (not tested yet)
    - Initial texture is default white => could be achieved?
    - Parse texture atlas -
    - multiple active texture slots. => could be a sum, i.e. :
        int texture_slot_sum;
        for (int i = 0; i < t_sum; i++) {
            glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + i);
        }

Renderer:
    - Implement batch rendering
    - Use global vao
    - struct EZBatchRenderer;

Sprite:
    - Release Sprite - OK
    - ASSERTION!

Log:
    - DEBUG_ENABLED doesn't work

FIXME:
    - None (thankfully)
